## Building a Retaining Wall? How Many Concrete Bags You’ll Need

Retaining walls look simple — just stacked blocks holding back soil — but their stability depends heavily on the **concrete footing** beneath and sometimes the **grouted fill** inside the blocks. Knowing how many bags of concrete you’ll need is critical before you start digging or mixing.

Whether you’re building a small garden wall or a taller structural barrier, this guide will walk you through the practical math, site-tested methods, and bag estimates to make sure your wall stands solid and straight — without last-minute material runs.

## Why Accurate Bag Estimation Matters for Retaining Walls

Unlike a slab, which spreads load evenly, a retaining wall applies **uneven pressure** to its footing. The backfill soil creates lateral force, and the footing must resist both vertical and horizontal loads.  

That’s why retaining walls often require:

- A **continuous concrete footing** below frost depth.  
- **Core-filled or grouted cells** in block walls for stability.  
- **Drainage provisions** (perforated pipe or gravel backfill).  

Each of these elements uses concrete differently — and if you underestimate, you risk weak support or poor bonding. Using the [Concrete Bags Calculator](/calculators/concrete-bag-calculator) ensures you have enough mix to fill both the footing and any hollow cores safely.

## Step-by-Step: Calculating Bags for a Retaining Wall Footing

Let’s start with the base footing — the most concrete-intensive part of the structure.

### Step 1 — Measure Footing Dimensions

Typical small retaining walls use a footing that’s **twice as wide as the wall thickness** and at least **8–12 inches thick**.  

For example, a 6-inch thick wall might use a footing:

Width = 12 in (1 ft)
Thickness = 12 in (1 ft)
Length = 20 ft


Convert everything into feet for easy calculation.

### Step 2 — Calculate Volume

Volume = Length × Width × Thickness
Volume = 20 × 1 × 1 = 20 ft³


Convert to cubic yards:

20 ÷ 27 = 0.74 yd³


### Step 3 — Convert Volume to Bags

Using the yield data (80 lb bag = 0.60 ft³ or 45 bags/yd³):

Bags = 0.74 × 45 = 33.3 → round up to 34 bags


You’ll need **34 bags of 80 lb concrete** for the footing.

If you’re using smaller 60 lb bags:

Bags = 0.74 × 60 = 44.4 → round up to 45 bags


Always round up — it’s easier to store an extra bag than to stop mid-pour.

## Example: Filling Concrete Blocks for a 20-ft Wall

Some retaining walls use **hollow core concrete blocks** reinforced with rebar and filled with grout or concrete for added strength. Let’s calculate for that too.

### Step 1 — Determine Wall Dimensions

Say your wall is **20 ft long, 3 ft high**, using 8x8x16-inch blocks (0.667 ft high × 1.33 ft long each). You’ll have:

Blocks = 20 ÷ 1.33 = 15 blocks per course
Courses = 3 ÷ 0.667 = 4.5 → 5 courses
Total blocks = 15 × 5 = 75 blocks


### Step 2 — Volume of Fill per Block

A typical 8x8x16-inch block has about **0.025 yd³ (0.67 ft³)** of fill volume when fully grouted.

Total Volume = 75 × 0.67 = 50.25 ft³ = 1.86 yd³


### Step 3 — Convert to Bags

For 80 lb bags (45 per yd³):

1.86 × 45 = 83.7 → 84 bags


So, **84 bags for block fill**, plus 34 bags for the footing = **118 bags total** for the project.

That’s for a small wall — about 20 ft long and 3 ft tall — with a fully grouted core and a standard footing.

## Quick Reference Table — Retaining Wall Concrete Estimates

| Wall Type | Wall Length | Wall Height | Typical Footing (ft) | Approx. Total Bags (80 lb) |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Garden Wall (no grout) | 10 ft | 2 ft | 10×1×1 | 18–20 bags |
| Retaining Wall (grouted) | 20 ft | 3 ft | 20×1×1 | 115–120 bags |
| Structural Wall | 30 ft | 4 ft | 30×1.5×1 | 175–190 bags |
| Heavy-Duty Wall (5–6 ft) | 20 ft | 5 ft | 20×2×1 | 220–250 bags |

These estimates include footing and grout fill with about **5–10% waste allowance**.

## Pro Tips from the Field

### 1. **Add 10% for Waste and Irregular Excavation**
Uneven trenches and air pockets in block cells always consume extra mix. A good rule is to multiply your final bag count by 1.10 to stay safe.

### 2. **Use Higher-Strength Mix for Footings**
Opt for **4000 PSI (≈ 28 MPa)** bag mixes for walls over 3 ft high or where load-bearing conditions exist. For short garden walls, 3000 PSI is usually adequate.

### 3. **Compact Subgrade and Level Forms**
A stable base prevents settlement cracks. Tamp gravel under the footing until firm, then level form edges before pouring.

### 4. **Batch and Mix Efficiently**
For walls requiring 50+ bags, a portable mixer or tow-behind batch mixer is worth it. Hand-mixing that many bags is exhausting and inconsistent.

### 5. **Keep a Continuous Pour**
Avoid cold joints — pour the footing in one go. For grouting block cores, fill every second course as you build to maintain consistent bonding.

### 6. **Add Drainage Behind the Wall**
A 4-inch perforated pipe with gravel backfill prevents hydrostatic pressure, which can undermine even well-reinforced walls.

## Adjusting Bag Counts for Different Bag Sizes

| Bag Size | Yield (ft³) | Bags per Cubic Yard | Adjustment Factor |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 40 lb | 0.30 | 90 | ×2.0 |
| 50 lb | 0.375 | 72 | ×1.6 |
| 60 lb | 0.45 | 60 | ×1.3 |
| 80 lb | 0.60 | 45 | Base reference |

To convert between sizes, multiply or divide by the adjustment factor shown above.  
For instance, if a project requires 100 of the 80 lb bags, you’d need roughly **130 of the 60 lb bags** or **200 of the 40 lb bags**.

## Common Field Questions

### **How deep should my retaining wall footing be?**
Generally, **as deep as the wall is tall** — but not less than 12 inches. Local codes or soil reports may specify more, especially on slopes or poor soil.

### **Can I pour concrete directly into soil without forms?**
Yes, for small garden walls under 2 ft, but formwork ensures straight edges and proper thickness. For structural walls, always use forms and rebar.

### **What about using post-hole concrete instead?**
Fast-setting post mixes (like QUIKRETE Fast-Set) are convenient for fence posts but not ideal for footings or grout because of limited work time and variable density.

### **How do I check if I ordered enough?**
Use the [Concrete Bags Calculator](/calculators/concrete-bag-calculator). It automatically calculates bag counts for custom footing or wall fill dimensions, including waste allowance and conversion between cubic feet, yards, or metres.
