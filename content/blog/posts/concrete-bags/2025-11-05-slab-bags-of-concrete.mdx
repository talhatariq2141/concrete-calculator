## Slab Pouring Made Simple: How Many Concrete Bags You’ll Need

If you’re planning a small slab — a patio, shed floor, or even a garage base — one of the first things you’ll ask is, **“How many bags of concrete do I need?”**  

Getting this number right means saving both money and time. Buy too few bags, and you’ll run short mid-pour. Order too many, and you’ve spent extra on materials you don’t need.  

This guide walks you through the correct formula, field-proven examples, and quick reference tables to estimate **bag counts for concrete slabs** accurately. Whether you’re a DIY homeowner or a professional crew member, you’ll be able to size your pour confidently.

## Understanding Slab Volume and Bag Yield  

Every concrete slab calculation starts with **volume** — how much space your slab will fill once poured. You’ll express this in **cubic feet or cubic yards**, then match it to how much concrete each bag yields.

- **1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet**  
- **1 cubic meter = 35.3147 cubic feet**  

The basic formula to find slab volume is:

Volume = Length × Width × Thickness


Thickness is often the wild card — 4 inches is standard for patios and floors, while 5–6 inches may be used for garages or driveways.  

Once you know the volume, convert it into **bag counts** using manufacturer yield data. Here’s the quick chart most contractors carry in their trucks:

| Bag Size | Yield (ft³) | Bags per Cubic Yard |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| 40 lb | 0.30 | 90 |
| 50 lb | 0.375 | 72 |
| 60 lb | 0.45 | 60 |
| 80 lb | 0.60 | 45 |

That means if your slab totals 1 cubic yard of concrete, you’ll need roughly **45 of the 80 lb bags**, **60 of the 60 lb bags**, or **90 of the 40 lb bags**.

---

## Step-by-Step: From Dimensions to Bag Count  

Let’s go step by step with a realistic slab example.

### Step 1 — Measure the Slab  
Say you’re pouring a **10 ft × 10 ft slab** that’s **4 inches thick**.

Convert thickness to feet:  
4 in ÷ 12 = 0.333 ft  

Now calculate the slab volume:  
Volume = 10 × 10 × 0.333 = 33.3 ft³

### Step 2 — Convert to Cubic Yards  
33.3 ÷ 27 = 1.23 yd³


That means your slab will need about **1.23 cubic yards** of concrete.

### Step 3 — Determine Bags per Yard  
Using the 80 lb bag yield (0.60 ft³ per bag or 45 bags/yd³):

Bags = 1.23 × 45 = 55.4 → round up to 56 bags


So, a 10×10×4" slab requires about **56 bags of 80 lb concrete mix**.

## Example Calculations for Common Slab Sizes  

To make things practical, here’s a quick guide to common slab sizes and approximate bag requirements:

| Slab Size (ft) | Thickness (in) | Volume (yd³) | 40 lb Bags | 60 lb Bags | 80 lb Bags |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 8×8 | 4 | 0.79 | 71 | 48 | 36 |
| 10×10 | 4 | 1.23 | 111 | 74 | 56 |
| 12×12 | 4 | 1.78 | 160 | 107 | 80 |
| 10×12 | 5 | 1.85 | 166 | 111 | 83 |
| 12×16 | 4 | 2.37 | 213 | 142 | 106 |
| 20×20 | 4 | 4.93 | 444 | 296 | 222 |
| 20×20 | 6 | 7.39 | 666 | 444 | 333 |

> **Field Tip:** Always round bag counts up to the nearest whole bag and add **5–10% extra** for waste, overfill, or subgrade variation.

## Using the Formula Directly  

If you’d like to do your own math on site, this is the working formula that gives you bag counts directly:

Bags = (Length × Width × Thickness × 0.037037) × (Bags per Yard)


The constant 0.037037 converts cubic feet to cubic yards.  

For example:  
A 12 ft × 10 ft × 4 in slab using 60 lb bags (60 bags per yard):

Bags = (12 × 10 × 0.333 × 0.037037) × 60 = 53.3 → 54 bags

## Choosing the Right Mix  

Not all bagged concrete mixes are the same. The correct mix depends on what the slab will support.

| Mix Type | Strength | Typical Use |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| General Purpose (3000 psi) | Patios, paths, walkways | Smooth finish, moderate load |
| High Strength (4000–5000 psi) | Garages, driveways | Better durability, heavier loads |
| Crack Resistant | Same as above + fibers | Reduces shrinkage cracking |
| Fast Setting | 2500–3000 psi | Fence posts, small repairs |

For a typical slab or patio, 3000–4000 psi general-purpose concrete is enough.  
If you’re building a garage floor or driveway, choose a **high-strength mix** with proper rebar or wire mesh reinforcement.

## Pro Tips from the Field  

- **Subgrade prep is everything.** Compact gravel or sand base well to avoid settling and cracking later.  
- **Add control joints.** For large slabs, cut 10–12 ft intervals to control shrinkage cracks.  
- **Avoid overwatering.** Adding too much water weakens concrete and increases shrinkage.  
- **Batch evenly.** Mix full bags at consistent water ratios for a uniform slab finish.  
- **Plan for weather.** Pour early morning in summer to avoid rapid drying; cover with plastic for curing.  
- **Use mechanical mixers** when using 80 lb bags — hand mixing more than 30 bags is tough work.  
- **Reinforce where needed.** For heavy-duty slabs, wire mesh or #3 rebar at 12" spacing is standard.

## Quick Reference — Bag Count by Slab Thickness  

To estimate faster on site, use this rough chart for **1 square foot of slab area**:

| Thickness (in) | Cubic Feet per sq. ft | 80 lb Bags per 100 sq. ft |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 3" | 0.25 | 42 |
| 4" | 0.33 | 56 |
| 5" | 0.42 | 70 |
| 6" | 0.50 | 84 |

That means a **100 sq. ft** patio at 4" thick will need **about 56 bags of 80 lb mix**, which aligns with our earlier full example.

## Conclusion  

Estimating bags for a slab doesn’t need to be guesswork. Once you know your slab’s length, width, and thickness, use the yield chart or formula to determine total bags. Round up, add 5–10% for safety, and always check the mix strength rating to match your application.
