## How Many Concrete Bags Are There in a Yard?

If you’ve ever stood in a hardware store staring at stacks of concrete mix bags, wondering *“How many of these do I need to make one cubic yard of concrete?”* — you’re not alone.  

Contractors, DIYers, and even suppliers often need quick conversions between **bag counts** and **cubic yard volume** to plan materials, estimate costs, or schedule a pour efficiently.

This guide breaks down **exact bag counts per cubic yard** for every common mix size — 40 lb, 50 lb, 60 lb, 80 lb, and 20 kg bags — along with field-tested math and quick reference tables for real-world use.

---

## Why “Bags per Yard” Matters

One cubic yard of concrete equals **27 cubic feet** of material.  
But bagged concrete mixes (like those from Quikrete or Sakrete) yield far less than a full cubic foot per bag — the actual yield depends on bag weight and mix composition.

Knowing how many bags make up a yard helps you:

- Plan and budget concrete for slabs, posts, or footings  
- Compare mix types or bag sizes for cost efficiency  
- Avoid running short mid-pour — one of the most common jobsite mistakes  

You can also verify this easily with the [Concrete Bags Calculator](/calculators/concrete-bag-calculator), which applies these same yield conversions automatically.

## Step 1 — Understanding Bag Yields

Each bag of pre-mixed concrete produces a certain volume when combined with water. The yield depends on the mix density and aggregate content.

Below is the average yield of each bag size based on standard manufacturer data:

| Bag Weight | Yield (ft³) | Bags per Cubic Yard (27 ft³) |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| 40 lb | 0.30 | 90 |
| 50 lb | 0.375 | 72 |
| 60 lb | 0.45 | 60 |
| 80 lb | 0.60 | 45 |
| 20 kg (metric) | 0.33 | 82 |

These values assume a properly mixed batch with no water excess and good compaction. Small field variations (±5%) are normal due to air entrainment, moisture, and mixing technique.

---

## Step 2 — The Formula for Bags per Yard

If you want to calculate it yourself, here’s the formula:

Bags = Volume (yd³) × (27 ÷ Bag Yield)


Since each cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet, dividing 27 by the bag yield gives you the number of bags needed per yard.

### Example:
For 60 lb bags (0.45 ft³ yield):

Bags = 1 × (27 ÷ 0.45) = 60 bags per cubic yard

If you need half a yard of concrete:

Bags = 0.5 × 60 = 30 bags


Simple and reliable — this is the same math used by ready-mix estimators and concrete suppliers.



## Step 3 — Example Calculations for Common Projects

Let’s look at a few practical examples to see how “bags per yard” applies in real work scenarios.

### Example 1 — Small Patio Slab  
You’re pouring a **10 ft × 10 ft slab**, **4 inches thick**.

Volume = 10 × 10 × 0.333 = 33.3 ft³
33.3 ÷ 27 = 1.23 yd³


For **80 lb bags (45 bags/yd³):**

Bags = 1.23 × 45 = 55.4 → round to 56 bags


For **60 lb bags (60 bags/yd³):**

Bags = 1.23 × 60 = 73.8 → round to 74 bags


So, you’ll need about **56 of the 80 lb bags** or **74 of the 60 lb bags**.

---

### Example 2 — Fence Posts  
You’re setting **10 posts**, each hole requiring **1.25 ft³** of concrete.

Total volume = 10 × 1.25 = 12.5 ft³ = 12.5 ÷ 27 = 0.46 yd³


For **60 lb bags:**
0.46 × 60 = 27.6 → 28 bags


For **80 lb bags:**
0.46 × 45 = 20.7 → 21 bags


Always add one or two extra bags to cover spillage or uneven holes.

---

### Example 3 — Garage Footings  
A footing measures **2 ft wide × 1 ft thick × 40 ft long**.

Volume = 2 × 1 × 40 = 80 ft³
80 ÷ 27 = 2.96 yd³


For **80 lb bags (45/yd³):**

2.96 × 45 = 133.2 → round to 134 bags


That means roughly **134 of the 80 lb bags** or **178 of the 60 lb bags** for the same pour.

## Quick Reference — Bags per Yard and Fractional Yards

Here’s a compact chart showing approximate bag counts for different yardages.

| Bag Weight | ¼ Yard | ½ Yard | ¾ Yard | 1 Yard | 1½ Yards |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 40 lb | 23 | 45 | 68 | 90 | 135 |
| 50 lb | 18 | 36 | 54 | 72 | 108 |
| 60 lb | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 | 90 |
| 80 lb | 11 | 23 | 34 | 45 | 68 |
| 20 kg | 21 | 41 | 62 | 82 | 123 |

> **Tip:** For small pours (under ½ yard), consider fast-setting mixes in 50–60 lb bags — they’re easier to handle and ideal for patching, steps, or post bases.

---

## Step 4 — Choosing Bag Size for Your Project

Each bag size offers a balance between **handling ease** and **mixing efficiency**:

| Bag Size | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **40 lb** | Easy to lift, good for small work | More bags = more mixing time |
| **50 lb** | Common in DIY use, moderate handling | Slightly lower yield |
| **60 lb** | Best balance for most users | Heavier for long jobs |
| **80 lb** | Fewer bags, faster batching | Heavy to carry and mix manually |
| **20 kg (metric)** | Common in UK, AU, CA markets | Moderate yield per bag |

For hand-mixed jobs, most pros prefer **60 lb** or **80 lb** mixes. For wheelbarrow or portable mixer batches, heavier bags reduce total mixing cycles.

## Step 5 — Waste and Overfill Allowance  

Even when math is perfect, concrete isn’t.  
Rough subgrade, uneven forms, or over-troweling can all consume more material than expected.  

A smart contractor always adds **5–10% extra** for these real-world variables.

Adjusted Bags = Bags × 1.05 (for 5% waste)



Example:  
If you calculated 60 bags exactly for 1 yard:  
60 × 1.05 = 63 bags → keep 3 extra on site



That small buffer prevents an emergency run mid-pour.

## Step 6 — When to Consider Ready-Mix Instead  

Bagged concrete is ideal for small to medium pours (up to about 1–1.5 yards).  
Beyond that, it becomes labor-intensive and sometimes more expensive than ordering ready-mix.

**Rule of thumb:**
- Up to **1 yd³** — bagged mix is fine  
- Over **2 yd³** — call a local ready-mix plant  

For 2 yards, you’d need **120 of the 60 lb bags** or **90 of the 80 lb bags** — that’s a full day’s work for two people mixing manually.

## Pro Tips and Field Notes  

- **Mix consistently:** Always measure water accurately per bag to maintain uniform strength.  
- **Batch close to the pour:** Concrete begins setting in 30–60 minutes; don’t mix too far in advance.  
- **Use clean water and tools:** Contaminants affect setting and color.  
- **Combine partial bags cautiously:** Half-used bags can clump or absorb moisture.  
- **Check expiration dates:** Cement compounds degrade over time; use fresh stock.  
- **Reinforce wisely:** Add rebar, mesh, or fiber mix if your slab or footing will bear heavy loads.  
- **Temperature and humidity matter:** In hot weather, keep your mix shaded and cure with water for at least 3 days.
