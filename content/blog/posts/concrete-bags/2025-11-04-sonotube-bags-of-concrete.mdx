## How Many Bags of Concrete for a Sonotube? A Practical Guide

If you’re setting fence posts, deck footings, or any vertical columns, you’ve probably come across **Sonotubes** — those round cardboard forms that make pouring cylindrical concrete footings simple and professional.  

But the most common question builders and homeowners ask is:  
**“How many bags of concrete do I need for each Sonotube?”**  

Getting this right is important — underestimating leaves you short during a pour, while overestimating means wasted mix and cost. This guide explains the math, gives you quick reference tables for standard tube sizes, and shows you how to apply real site logic when estimating concrete for Sonotubes.

## Understanding What a Sonotube Does

A **Sonotube (or concrete form tube)** is a round form used to shape vertical concrete columns or footings. They’re typically used for:

- Deck and porch footings  
- Fence and sign posts  
- Light pole bases  
- Structural piers and foundation pads  

Sonotubes come in standard diameters such as 6", 8", 10", 12", and 18", and lengths typically 4 feet (48 inches).  

To find how much concrete each tube needs, you’ll calculate the **cylindrical volume** — then convert that into **bag counts** based on your chosen mix (40, 50, 60, or 80 lb bags).

---

## Step 1 — Formula for Sonotube Volume  

The volume of a cylinder is calculated as:

Volume = π × r² × h



Where:  
- π = 3.1416  
- r = radius in feet  
- h = height in feet  

Since most Sonotubes are measured in inches, convert to feet first.

For example:  
An 8" diameter × 4' (48") tall tube  
- Radius = 8 ÷ 2 = 4 in = 4 ÷ 12 = 0.333 ft  
- Height = 4 ft  

Volume = 3.1416 × (0.333)² × 4 = 1.394 ft³


So, an 8" × 4' tube holds approximately **1.39 cubic feet** of concrete.

---

## Step 2 — Convert Volume to Bag Count  

Now that you know the volume, divide it by the yield per bag for the mix you’re using.  

**Typical bag yields:**

| Bag Weight | Approx. Yield (ft³) | Bags per yd³ (27 ft³) |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 40 lb | 0.30 | 90 |
| 50 lb | 0.375 | 72 |
| 60 lb | 0.45 | 60 |
| 80 lb | 0.60 | 45 |

**Formula:**

Bags = Tube Volume (ft³) ÷ Bag Yield (ft³)



**Example (using 80 lb bags):**
Bags = 1.394 ÷ 0.60 = 2.32 → round up to 3 bags


So, an 8" × 4' Sonotube requires roughly **3 bags of 80 lb concrete**.

---

## Step 3 — Quick Reference Chart  

Here’s a handy chart of pre-calculated estimates for the most common Sonotube sizes (based on 4' tube height):

| Tube Diameter (in) | Volume (ft³) | 40 lb Bags | 50 lb Bags | 60 lb Bags | 80 lb Bags |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 6" | 0.785 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 8" | 1.39 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 |
| 10" | 2.18 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 4 |
| 12" | 3.14 | 11 | 9 | 7 | 6 |
| 14" | 4.28 | 15 | 12 | 10 | 7 |
| 16" | 5.59 | 19 | 15 | 12 | 9 |
| 18" | 7.07 | 24 | 19 | 16 | 12 |

These numbers already include standard rounding for real jobsite conditions. If you’re pouring multiple tubes, multiply accordingly — for instance, six 12" tubes will need roughly **6 × 6 = 36 of the 80 lb bags**.

> **Pro Tip:** Always round up to the next full bag and keep one or two extra per job. It’s better to have leftover mix than to run short in the middle of a pour.

---

## Step 4 — Adjust for Tube Height  

Not all Sonotubes are 4 feet tall. Use this adjustment formula if your tube is shorter or taller:

Adjusted Volume = (Actual Height ÷ 48) × 4-ft Volume


**Example:**  
If your 10" diameter tube is only 3' tall:  
Adjusted Volume = (36 ÷ 48) × 2.18 = 1.64 ft³

For 60 lb bags (0.45 ft³ yield):  
1.64 ÷ 0.45 = 3.64 → round to 4 bags

So a 10" × 3' tube will need 4 bags of 60 lb mix.

---

## Step 5 — Check for Concrete Type and Conditions  

The **type of concrete mix** also affects bag count and performance.  

| Mix Type | Strength (psi) | Typical Use | Note |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------|
| General Purpose | 3000 psi | Light-duty footings, posts | Standard choice for most Sonotube pours |
| High-Strength | 4000–5000 psi | Decks, heavy loads | Slightly lower yield (≈ 0.55 ft³/bag for 80 lb) |
| Fast-Setting | 2500–3000 psi | Fence posts, small jobs | Quick curing; set within 30–40 minutes |
| Crack-Resistant | 3500 psi | Exposed footings | Contains fibers to reduce cracking |

If your tubes support a deck, pergola, or structural beam, choose **4000 psi or higher** strength mix.  
For fence or sign posts, general-purpose or fast-setting bags are sufficient.

## Example — Full Job Calculation  

**Project:** Pouring six 12" diameter × 4' tall Sonotubes for a deck.  

1. **Volume per tube:** 3.14 ft³  
2. **Total volume:** 3.14 × 6 = 18.84 ft³  
3. **Bag yield (80 lb):** 0.60 ft³  
4. **Bags required:** 18.84 ÷ 0.60 = 31.4 → round to 32 bags  

**Result:**  
You’ll need approximately **32 of the 80 lb bags** to fill six 12" × 4' Sonotubes.

For extra safety, always add **5–10%** more — so order **34–35 bags total**.

## Field Notes and Pro Tips  

- **Consolidate properly:** After pouring each tube, rod or vibrate the mix lightly to remove trapped air.  
- **Cut tubes to fit formwork:** Sonotubes are easy to trim with a handsaw if footing heights vary.  
- **Check for frost line:** In colder climates, ensure footings extend below frost depth to avoid heaving.  
- **Pour in layers:** For tall tubes, pour halfway, rod, then finish the rest for a consistent, void-free column.  
- **Keep tops clean:** If you’re embedding post anchors, smooth the top surface and insert brackets while the mix is still wet.  
- **Mix on-site near the forms:** Moving full tubes is almost impossible once poured.

## Conclusion  

Estimating concrete for Sonotubes isn’t complicated once you understand the cylinder formula and bag yields. Measure the tube, calculate its volume, and divide by the yield of your chosen bag size. Add a little extra for waste, and you’ll never come up short again.
